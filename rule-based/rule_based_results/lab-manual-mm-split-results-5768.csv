"Rather, members agreed that inflation was likely to moderate in coming quarters,",2005,1,2
"While overall employment conditions, the buildup of household net worth, and access to financing would bolster consumer expendi- tures, members also cited a number of limiting factors.",2004,2,2

Equity prices in most foreign countries were up moderately since the January FOMC meeting.,2005,2,2

Members commented that the continued strong increases in energy and other commodity prices would prompt a difficult adjustment process involving both lower growth and higher rates of inflation in the near term.,2009,2,0
"In the view of one member, however, aggregate final demand was so strong that, with economic activity and the associated demand for labor having expanded at an unsustainable pace for some time, one could be reasonably confident that inflation would most likely pick up in the absence of policy action.",1996,1,0
"Indeed, the members did not rule out the emergence of appreciably lower inflation.",2016,0,1

"In the circumstances, most members endorsed a proposal to delete as no longer necessary the previous summary statement relating to the risks to growth and inflation taken together.",1996,2,2
"However, household spending had been relatively robust during the cyclical downturn and likely had only limited room for a pickup over coming quarters, and intense competitive pressures could well constrain profits, investment, and equity prices.",2007,2,2
"The recent decline in the dollar was another factor that could add to inflation pressures,",2011,1,0
still being clear about the Committee's intention to provide the monetary accommodation needed to support a return to maximum employment and stable prices.,2008,0,0
"Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had moderated from its strong fourth-quarter pace, while business fixed investment continued to grow strongly.",2008,2,0
"These included a decline in the cost of business capital, a recent rise in orders and backlogs of nondefense capital goods, persisting gains in productivity that undoubtedly pointed to growing profit opportunities, progress in strengthening business balance sheets, and reduced capital overhangs.",2020,1,0
they rebounded late in the period in response to the release of firmer economic data and growing concerns regarding the sustainability of current domestic asset prices.,2016,0,1
"Looking ahead, an abatement or reversal of some of the temporary factors reducing prices was likely to raise measured inflation.",2019,1,1
"Looking ahead, reports from retailer contacts were somewhat mixed; many anticipated relatively depressed holiday sales and where possible were making efforts to limit buildups of holiday merchandise, while other retailers were confident that sales would be reasonably well maintained, albeit generally somewhat below levels or growth rates experienced in previous holiday seasons.",2019,2,1
"Participants discussed the open market operations that the Federal Reserve had undertaken since September to implement monetary policy, as well as forthcoming operational measures.",1998,2,2

"For 2000, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis in June to retain the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1999 to the fourth quarter of 2000.",2007,2,2
"This policy preference was based on expectations of growth in business activity at a pace averaging in the vicinity of the economy's potential, a perception among the members that the risks to such an outlook were more balanced than earlier, and anticipations that under these circumstances inflation would remain constrained.",2004,2,2
The staff also reduced slightly its forecast of growth next year,2000,0,1
"Recent declines in payroll employment and industrial production, while still sizable, were smaller than those registered earlier in 2009.",2007,0,0

"Labor demand remained strong, and the labor market continued to be very tight.",2005,0,0
These members expected that the target range would be maintained at this level until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.,2002,2,2
"With inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.",1999,2,0
"as a result, headline PCE price inflation was expected to substantially exceed core PCE price inflation in 2008.",2017,2,2
Those indicators were mixed regarding the pace of economic activity within the manufacturing sector.,2000,2,2
"Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) at least at the current pace to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.",2008,0,0
"In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.",1997,0,0
The slowdown would reflect factors that were expected to damp the growth of overall business investment spending and a greater saturation of potential computer markets that might lead to more emphasis on replacement demand rather than the further expansion of capacity.,2000,0,1
Persistently strong demand and increasingly supportive conditions in debt and equity markets suggested the possibility of rising inflation pressures.,2001,1,0
"A number of participants noted that continued high unemployment, particularly with large numbers of workers suffering very long spells of unemployment, would lead to an erosion of workers' skills that would have adverse consequences for those workers and for the economy's potential level of output in the longer term.",2003,0,0
"Although a spike in energy prices eroded real income growth in the second quarter, there were solid gains in wages and salaries.",2001,1,2
"In their assessment of the outlook for inflation, members agreed that",2014,2,2
"In the staff forecast prepared for this meeting, the economy was seen as likely to expand at a moderate pace, supported by accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions.",1996,0,0
"The recent decline in mortgage rates had sparked some refinancing and purchase activity, but the extent of the longer-term impact of lower rates on housing demand remained uncertain.",2011,0,1

"Although the unemployment rate has declined somewhat since the summer, it remains elevated.",2017,0,0
The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.,2001,0,1
"Inflation compensation for 2007 declined modestly, perhaps reflecting the further drop in spot energy prices, but was largely unchanged at longer maturities.",2004,2,0

"At longer maturities, yields drifted lower over most of the intermeeting period in response to incoming data that suggested economic growth would remain moderate and inflation subdued,",2016,0,0

"Price inflation had picked up a little but, abstracting from energy, had remained relatively subdued.",1996,2,0
"The absence of further large gains in stock prices, should recent trends persist, would remove this stimulus and probably induce some moderation in the growth of consumer spending.",2010,2,2
"Mr. Kocherlakota dissented because, in his view, the new forward guidance in the fifth paragraph of the statement would weaken the credibility of the Committee's commitment to its inflation goal by failing to communicate purposeful steps to more rapidly increase inflation to the 2 percent target and by suggesting that the Committee views inflation persistently below 2 percent as an acceptable outcome.",2005,0,0
"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999.",2017,2,2
